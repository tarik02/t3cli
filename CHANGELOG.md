## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- 267ba43: Reuse upstream client-runtime authorization and RPC session creation for CLI connections.

### Patch Changes

- d70687f: Keep RPC connections compatible with server config fields the CLI does not use.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 690e901: Add the root `t3cli action` command group for project-defined toolbar actions.
- 4e62957: Improve human-readable CLI output with table layouts and markdown-rendered transcripts.
- 82f218c: Use the upstream t3tools contracts workspace package directly instead of local import aliases.
- 58c598c: Add multi-environment auth with encrypted credential storage.

  ### Features
  - Store multiple named auth environments in `~/.config/t3cli/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/t3cli/config.json`).
  - Encrypt tokens at rest with AES-256-GCM; bind ciphertext to environment name, URL, and `local` flag via additional authenticated data.
  - Store the master key in the OS keyring when available (`@napi-rs/keyring`), otherwise in `~/.config/t3cli/key` with `0600` permissions.
  - Migrate legacy v1 flat config (plaintext `url`/`token`) to encrypted v2 on first read; rewrite `config.json` automatically.
  - Add global `--environment <name>` flag and `T3CLI_ENV` for per-command environment selection.
  - Add `T3CODE_URL` + `T3CODE_TOKEN` override when both are set.
  - Add `env list`, `env use`, and `env remove` commands for managing stored environments.
  - Add `--name` and `--replace` flags to `auth pair` and `auth local`.
  - Verify credential decryption before switching the default environment (`env use`).

  ### Breaking changes

  **CLI**

  - `auth list`, `auth use`, and `auth unpair` are removed. Use `env list`, `env use`, and `env remove` instead.
  - `auth unpair` is renamed to `env remove` (same behavior: removes local credentials only).

  **Library (`t3code-cli/config`)**

  - `T3ConfigLive`, `makeT3Config`, `UrlError`, and `StoredConfig` are removed from the public export surface.
  - Import config services via namespace exports instead: `Config`, `Credential`, `Keystore`, `Selection`, `Env`, `Paths`, `Url`, `EnvironmentName`.
  - `ResolvedConfig` remains exported but now includes optional `environment` and a `source` discriminator (`config` | `env`).

  **Library (`t3code-cli/connection`)**

  - `T3CodeNodeRpcLayer` is no longer exported from `t3code-cli/connection`. Import it from `t3code-cli/node`.

  **Library (`t3code-cli/runtime` and `t3code-cli/node`)**

  - `NodeEnvironmentLive` is removed. Environment/process snapshot access moved to `CliRuntime` under `t3code-cli/cli`.

  ### Upgrade notes
  - Existing single-environment v1 configs upgrade automatically on the first command that reads config.
  - After upgrade, tokens are encrypted; keep the OS keyring entry or `~/.config/t3cli/key` file backed up if you rely on stored credentials.
  - Scripts using `auth list`, `auth use`, or `auth unpair` must switch to the `env` subcommands.

### Patch Changes

- 244f5bc: Reject unexpected positional arguments on CLI commands instead of silently ignoring them.

- 33c587c: Move common thread workflow commands to the root CLI surface and rename `messages` to `transcript`.

### Patch Changes

- 7d67d83: Treat ready sessions with stale running turn snapshots as complete when an assistant response is present, fixing thread callbacks that were registered before source thread completion.

## 0.9.1

### Patch Changes

- ba0c671: Fix background thread callbacks exiting before delivery.

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 3652760: Add `thread show`, `thread approve`, and `thread respond` commands.

### Patch Changes

- 7942f5b: Restructure `vp pack` output into a single `shared.js` chunk plus thin named entry files (no hashed chunk filenames).
- 59225bc: Restructure README with improved navigation and add self-identity guidance to skill.

  - README now has clearer sections: Quick Start, Authentication, Project Management, Models, Thread Management
  - Skill updated with guidance to use `t3cli thread show` to check identity before spawning threads
  - Agents should prefer same provider and model family when starting new threads

- bbdbdf0: Add self-archive protection to `thread archive` with `--force` override.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1c4e911: add t3cli thread callback command

  new subcommand to watch a thread and send a message when it completes:

  - --from: source thread id to watch
  - --thread: target thread id (or T3CODE_THREAD_ID env var)
  - --prompt: message to send
  - --background: fork detached watcher process

  use cases: async handoffs, parallel work notifications

### Patch Changes

- 73652ca: Update `upstream-t3code` submodule to latest `main`.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- e38eeb8: fix project resolution precedence for nested worktrees and paths

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- de470d8: Restructure the public API for library consumers such as `t3-goals`.

  - Add package.json subpath exports: `./layout`, `./orchestration`, `./rpc`, `./auth`, `./config`, `./connection`, `./runtime`, `./application`, `./contracts`, and `./t3tools`
  - Export the full bundled `@t3tools/contracts` surface as `t3code-cli/t3tools`
  - Add `resolveT3BaseDir`, `readT3LayoutFromNodeProcess`, and `T3Layout` under `t3code-cli/layout`
  - Export `T3OrchestrationLayer`, `T3Orchestration`, and related types under `t3code-cli/orchestration`
  - Export `RpcError` under `t3code-cli/rpc`
  - Slim the default export to the application surface plus `AppLayer` and `AuthAppLayer`

  **BREAKING:** The default export no longer includes `Environment`, `EnvironmentShape`, `NodeEnvironmentLive`, `SqlClientFactory`, auth/config/connection/runtime layer exports, or contract type re-exports. Use subpath imports where those surfaces remain public.

- c83b1f5: Restructure the CLI command surface for agent and human ergonomics.

  - Rename command groups: `projects` → `project`, `models` → `model`, `threads` → `thread`
  - Replace positional project/thread refs with `--project` and `--thread` flags
  - Make `--project` optional with cwd-based resolution (id, workspace root, or nested worktree path)
  - Infer worktree path from cwd when starting a thread inside a project subdirectory
  - Add `project add --path` (defaults to `.`) and `auth pair --url`
  - Add env fallbacks: `T3CODE_PROJECT_ROOT`, `T3CODE_PROJECT_ID`, `T3CODE_WORKTREE_PATH`, `T3CODE_THREAD_ID`
  - Export CLI flags and scope resolvers as library surfaces: `t3code-cli/cli` (flags) and `t3code-cli/scope`

  **BREAKING:** All previous CLI command names and positional arguments are removed. Update scripts and integrations to the new surface.

- e1555b9: Add a bundled agent skill for operating `t3cli` from agents.
  - Skill lives at `skills/t3code-cli/` with setup and command reference docs
  - Install with `npx skills add tarik02/t3cli`

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8d1d06e: Export local and pairing auth services, supporting environment/config/sqlite layers, and split token issuance from config writes for programmatic auth flows.
